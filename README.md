# Hantek DRC Converter
### Hantek oscilloscope 6000 series drc file converter to text data (csv)<br>

Standart Hantek program can record osc data to .drc file. But you can process it only with the Hantek program. So, it isn't possible to use recorded data with Exel, Matlab, etc.<br>

This program helps you to display OSC data and covert .drc files to text csv format.<br>

You can use prebuild windows program from the build folder. Or you can compile it from sourcecode. It uses Desktop Qt 6.4.3 MinGW 64bit and qCustomPlot 2.1.1. 
I research drc file for the Hantek 6000 series recorded with Hantek6000 v.2.2.7 official program.<br>
Due to Hantek company doesn't provide any details on their DRC data format, it is hard to understand drc protocole. Converter should work with 6000 series, but I'm not shure that it will work with others Hantek oscilloscopes. If you have any other drc files, you can write me, to research them.<br>
